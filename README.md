# COMP 170 SU25 WEEK 10

This assignment has two parts: a reflection part to evaluate work you have already submitted and **a reflection to evaluation your overall work and propose your final grade for the course.**


## Finals week policy

There is no final exam for the course. There will be a final assignemnt that will be published the week before finals and will be due the week of finals. Additionally, 8 students in the course will be invited randomly to a brief meeting with the instructor during the course's final exam slot. 

These meetings will be scheduled on **Wednesday August 6, from 11 AM to 1 PM** in 15-minute slots. If you are selected, randomly, for an oral followup, you will be notified by email on Monday 8/4/25 at 11 AM.



## Reflect (on the last homework assignment)

Review the [posted solutions from the previous assignment](./solutions_week09.py). Compare the posted solutions with your solutions. Notice the differences between your code and the solutions code and describe them. Trivial differences like the names of variables are not that important.

*Write the reflection for the last homework assignment in a file named `assignment_reflection`. This can be a txt file or a markdown file.*

### Frequent mistakes expected at this point

* Your code has multiple return statements.

* **Code has no comments** to demonstrate mastery of the program.

* You did not test your methods to verify they work property.


# Reflect (on the course)

*Write the reflection for the course in a file named `final_reflection`. This can be a txt file or a markdown file. The last paragraph of your reflection should be a sentence in the form: "Based on the above, I propose X as my final grade.* Replace X with A, B, C, or D.

As part of this course’s approach to **ungrading**, your final reflection is an opportunity to evaluate your own learning, growth, and contributions. You will also propose your **final course grade** (**A**, **B**, **C**, or **D**). Please do not use pluses or minuses; I may apply them if I believe it’s appropriate based on your reflection and overall performance.


## 🧠 Framing the Reflection

Think of this course as a job you enjoyed — one where you were motivated to do well, grow your skills, and support the team. Would you say your performance this term deserves recognition, advancement, or improvement? Use that lens to guide your reflection.

Your self-evaluation should address the following areas as **indicators**, not rigid requirements. Use them to tell a thoughtful, honest story of how you approached the course.

If your proposed grade differs significantly from your assigned grade, I will provide you with a written explanation and an opportunity to discuss the matter with me.


## 📌 Key Areas for Reflection

### 1. Attendance & Punctuality
- Were you consistently present in class?
- Did you miss fewer than five class meetings?
- Did you arrive (or log in) on time — ideally before or by 11:30 AM?

### 2. Participation & Engagement
- Did you actively contribute to class discussions — either by answering questions, asking your own, or helping peers?
- Did you take initiative in your learning, e.g., exploring beyond the homework or trying optional problems?

### 3. Presence & Focus
- Were you fully mentally present during class sessions?
- Were you free from distractions like driving, traveling, or multitasking during Zoom classes?
- Did you seek help when needed — e.g., attending office hours, emailing questions, or discussing challenges?

### 4. Assignment Timeliness
- Did you submit your work on time and keep up with due dates?

### 5. Reflection & Growth
- Did you review the posted solutions thoughtfully?
- Did you compare them to your own work and reflect on improvements?
- Did you follow through on those reflections in future assignments?

### 6. Code Quality
- Did your code meet the assignment requirements?
- Did it reflect clear logic, correct functionality, and effort to improve based on feedback?


## 📣 Final Thoughts

In your reflection, you're encouraged to highlight specific moments where you:
- Overcame a challenge,
- Helped a classmate,
- Took initiative to go deeper,
- Or simply made progress you’re proud of.

This isn’t just about assigning yourself a grade — it’s about owning your learning journey.
